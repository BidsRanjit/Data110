# My hometown 
```
I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal. I lived
there for 12 years before My family, and I
moved to the United States. The city of
Kathmandu is a cultural and historical
treasure and the valley it sits in is
encircled by magnificent mountains. Its
winding, small alleyways are lined with
vibrant temples, lively markets, and the
friendly smiles of its locals.
